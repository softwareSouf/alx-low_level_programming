## Introduction

Make is a utility that automatically builds executable programs and libraries from source code by reading files called Makefiles. Makefiles contain instructions for compiling and linking code, allowing developers to automate the build process.

## What is Make?

Make is a build automation tool that manages dependencies between source files and targets (executables, libraries, etc.). It uses Makefiles to define how the code should be compiled, linked, and built.

## Makefiles

Makefiles are special files that provide a set of rules and instructions for building projects. They consist of targets, dependencies, and commands. Targets are what you want to build (e.g., executables), dependencies are the source files required, and commands are the instructions for compiling and linking.

## Rules

Rules define how to create a target and its dependencies. They consist of a target, a colon (:), dependencies, and commands. For example:

```
target: dependency1 dependency2
    command1
    command2
```

## Explicit and Implicit Rules

Explicit rules specify how to build targets explicitly. Implicit rules define how to create targets based on their file extensions. Make can use implicit rules to build targets when no explicit rule is provided.

## Common/Useful Rules

Some common/useful rules include:
- `all`: The default target that builds everything.
- `clean`: Removes generated files.
- `install`: Installs the program or files.
- `uninstall`: Removes installed files.

## Variables

Variables in Makefiles store values that can be reused throughout the file. They simplify the process of managing paths, compiler options, and other settings.

## Getting Started

To get started, make sure you have Ubuntu 20.04 LTS installed with gcc 9.3.0 and GNU Make 4.2.1.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory using the terminal.
3. Run the command `make` to build the project.
4. Use `make clean` to remove generated files.
5. Modify the Makefile and explore different rules and variables.
